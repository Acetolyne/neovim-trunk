## Maverick Chung

It feels so good to be able to cast off the oppressive chains of the GUI and return to primal terminal divinity, now with Trunk.

## Tyler Jang

This is the first thing I've seen in a long time that gives me some hope that I'll one day be able to exit vim.

## Gabriel Al-Harbi

This is incredible. This is so much better than I thought it could possibly be when I first heard you guys were doing this project. I would absolutely use this. Let me know if you want me to be your first beta user.
